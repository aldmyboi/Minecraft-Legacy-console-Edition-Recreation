# Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition Recreation
The legacy console editions of minecraft were special to me. not just because of the exclusive features but the amount of nostalgia, it was my first time playing minecraft
so i decided to try recreating it, ive tried to do this for years but i finally made a repository for it today.
