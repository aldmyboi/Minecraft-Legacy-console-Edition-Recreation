# Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition Recreation
The legacy console editions of minecraft were special to me. not just because of the exclusive features but the amount of nostalgia, it was my first time playing minecraft
so i decided to try recreating it, ive tried to do this for years but i finally made a repository for it today.

I am going to attempt to recreate the legacy console editions of minecraft, i'm pretty much planning to make a 1:1 recreation but i might add a few new features, please mind i am a beguinner and im still learning, if the code looks awful thats why :neckbeard:
